There’s a pleasant port where a
boy fixed his course
On a lesser-trodden landscape
north
And on his journey boreal met
one corporeal
One returning journey forth
“What draws you to the barren
there,” he said
“That land is nothing but
dampen dread
And sour berries, and rotten
cherries
And icy rime and that snowy,
snowy pine
That bleak, bare lawn is
woebegone
But carry, carry, carry on”
“Oh no,” he said “You must
have misunderstood
It’s not the land’s comestible
goods
Not the berry that I seek, but
the way it hangs on the arrow
wood
And I am not after that snowy
shawl
But the way the faint flakes
float and fall
And to me that alabaster milky
rime
Is as sweet as sugar and just as
fine
And I don’t care one bit that
the pines are gone
But I do care what they look
like at dawn
I’m not concerned that their
life is drawn
But what happens to the land
without their brawn.”
And so his journey goes, though
his story’s old
But a tale is not trite if it’s
still being told
