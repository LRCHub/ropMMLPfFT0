Supreme north the one and only
godless coldness
I am the one and only divine
A freedom sought by all that
cannot conquer
A life so free of the oppression
Bloodless coldness, wonder.
Deathless wilderness home.
Borealis supreme
Borealis supreme
Borealis supreme frosted
frontier
Borealis supreme, ideal beer.
Borealis supreme!
South cannot conquer us.
They wage a war, of attrition.
We fight back the way we can!
Bury them in the snow!
The true north strong and free
